## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Brillanti** was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a polished and interactive jewelry shopping experience. **HTML** provided the structure for key pages like product listings, individual item details, and the checkout process. **CSS** was used to craft an elegant, responsive design, ensuring that the layout and visuals—such as jewelry images and product displays—were both stylish and functional across different devices. **JavaScript** enabled dynamic interactions, such as product filtering, real-time updates to the shopping cart, and form validation during checkout, creating a smooth and engaging user experience for browsing and purchasing jewelry.

## Optimizations

Optimizing for Visual Appeal: Since jewelry relies heavily on visual presentation, ensuring high-quality images and an elegant, responsive design taught the importance of balancing aesthetics with performance to provide an attractive yet fast-loading shopping experience.

## Lessons Learned:

Smooth User Experience: Implementing seamless navigation between product categories, details, and checkout highlighted the need for a well-structured and intuitive user interface, making the shopping process effortless and enjoyable.
